        <h2>Blue Morph</h2>
        <p>Blue Morph is an interactive installation that uses nano-scale images and sounds derived from the metamorphosis of a caterpillar into a butterfly. Nano-technology takes the stage in this work, being used as symbolism to observe the cellular changes of a caterpillar's transformation into a butterfly. Sounds are used to illustrate the surges of transformation which might surprise the audience. These sounds might not be as gradual or pleasant as expected. These are the sounds of metamorphosis. 
        This work is still on display and has seen many different exhibitions starting with Happening. Integratron, Joshua Tree, CA, June 9th, 2007.
